NAME
    Kwiki::Trackback - Provide a trackback server within Kwiki and a place
    to display those trackbacks.

DESCRIPTION
    Trackback is a protocol developed by Six Apart to facillitate
    conversation amongst disparate content sources. It was first used
    between blogs, but is useful for proactively telling any piece of
    content that something out there is talking about it.

    You can see Kwiki::Trackback in action at
